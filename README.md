### Hi, my name is Robert Parsons and I am an aspiring iOS/mobile app developer!

- 🎓 I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a degree in computer science.
- 📱 For my senior project, I built the [SEES iPhone App](https://github.com/robertparsonsdev/SEESApp) and [SEES Admin iPad App](https://github.com/robertparsonsdev/SEESAdmin).
- ✅ During the pandemic, I built [Forming](https://github.com/robertparsonsdev/Forming) to help me stay on top of my habits. Find it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/forming/id1511563733)!
- 🗣 I have a mild stutter and I hope to one day build an app to help other stutterers.
